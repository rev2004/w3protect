# Introduction #

This package gives your website an extra boost of security when you cannot administer the server where your website is located.

The reason I am creating this project is because some people do not have administrative access to the server where their website is located. When there are no Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS) active, you can still have some form of protection by just scripting it.

W3Protect's configuration file lets you edit a lot of settings for features of the tool but also enable or disable features.

# Features #

Some of W3Protect its features are:

  * DNSBL banning
