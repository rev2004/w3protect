Welcome to the Project page of W3Protect.

## What is W3Protect? ##
W3Protect is a Web-Based security solution written in php. It can help website owners and possibly hosters to secure their systems just a little bit more. W3Protect is written by Patrick de Brouwer, owner of NLSecurity based in Rotterdam, The Netherlands.

W3Protect gives you as webmaster or hoster that extra feeling of security. An extra touch where other systems stop. W3Protect provides the following functions:

  * DNS BlackList (DNSBL) checking and blocking
  * IP-address blacklisting
  * Country-based blocking
  * Intrusion detection and prevention
  * MD5sum checking on (web)server for post-intrusion detection
  * E-mail alerting
  * A fancy WebUI for a good overview of events and details
  * More to come...

## Why was W3Protect built? ##
A lot of webmasters, companies and individuals have a website that is hosted on a shared server. This means the same server is used for multiple websites to be hosted on there. Most of the time, these webmasters do not have access to the server configuration and thus can not change any configuration or add security features. Have you heard of mod\_security? It has some functions that are equal to W3Protect. However, where there is not enough privileges on the server, or you just don't want to install other services, that's where W3Protect comes in.
