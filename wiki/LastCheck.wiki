_This page describes what LastCheck is._

= LastCheck =

The *LastCheck* value is a value within the md5sum table in the database. This value contains a timestamp of when the md5sum check was last executed. It needs this when md5sum checking is activated, to determine whether it should scan again or not.

It compares this towards the current time() value. Think of the following pseudo-code:

{{{
  [client]->[database]: Give me the LastCheck value
  [client]<-[database]: Okay. Value is currently: 1322041337

  store "1322041337" into variable $lastcheck
  store "time()" into variable $currenttime
  store "getperiodfromConfig" into variable $period
  store "calculate($currenttime + $period)" into variable $check

  check if ($check is larger than $lastcheck)
  if so: do md5sum check
  if not: ignore
}}}
